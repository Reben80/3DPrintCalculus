# **3D Printing Assignment: Collaborative Sphere Packing**

## **Objective**
This assignment introduces you to **Bambu Studio** and the **3D printing workflow** while emphasizing **communication and teamwork**. You will each design a unique **sphere**, ensuring all spheres collectively fit within **one print bed**. The final submission will be **one shared `.3mf` file** containing all spheres.

## **Learning Goals**
1. Install and use **Bambu Studio** for slicing and preparing prints.
2. Collaborate effectively to **plan a shared 3D print job**.
3. Gain hands-on experience with **basic 3D modeling** and **print bed optimization**.

## **Assignment Instructions**

### **Step 1: Install & Set Up Bambu Studio**
- Download and install **Bambu Studio** from [Bambu Lab's official site](https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio).
- Open the software and explore the interface.

### **Step 2: Design Your Sphere**
- Each student must **design a unique sphere** in the slicer **Bambu Studio**.
- **Size Constraint:** Every student’s sphere **must be a different size**.
- Export your sphere as a `.3mf` file.

### **Step 3: Collaborate & Fit All Spheres into One Bed**
- The class must work together to fit **all spheres within one print bed** using **Bambu Studio**.
- Ensure **no spheres overlap** and that they are **properly positioned for printing**.

### **Step 4: Final Submission**
- Submit **one final `.3mf` file** containing all spheres.
- **File Name:** `3DPrint_Spheres_Math182.3mf`
- Upload the `.3mf` file to **MS Teams/GitHub** before the deadline.
