This document explains how to create 3D plots in Mathematica for two specific regions with distinct geometric characteristics.

## Region 1: Triangular Base with Semicircular Cross-Sections

### Description
- **Base Shape**: The base of the solid \(S\) is a triangular region in the \(x-y\) plane, defined by the vertices \((0,0)\), \((3,0)\), and \((0,2)\).
- **Cross-Sections**: Cross-sections perpendicular to the \(y\)-axis are semicircles, extending upward in the \(z\)-direction.

### Mathematica Code
To visualize this structure, you would typically need to use a combination of plotting functions to create the triangular base and then overlay semicircular cross-sections. However, a direct approach using `ContourPlot3D` for this specific geometry is not straightforward due to its complexity.

## Region 2: Elliptical Base with Isosceles Right Triangle Cross-Sections

### Description
- **Base Shape**: The base of the solid \(S\) in the \(x-y\) plane is an elliptical region with the boundary curve defined by \(9x^2 + 4y^2 = 36\).
- **Cross-Sections**: Cross-sections perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis are isosceles right triangles, with the hypotenuse lying in the base plane and extending upward in the \(z\)-direction.

### Mathematica Code
For the elliptical base, you can visualize the ellipse using `ContourPlot` for the \(x-y\) plane. To add the isosceles right triangle cross-sections, you would need to creatively use Mathematica's 3D plotting capabilities, possibly through parametric definitions or manual layering of shapes.

```mathematica
ellipsePlot = ContourPlot[9 x^2 + 4 y^2 == 36, {x, -3, 3}, {y, -3, 3}, FrameLabel -> {x, y}];
```

**Note**: Actual 3D plotting of these complex structures involving specific cross-sections like semicircles and isosceles right triangles as described would require more advanced Mathematica techniques, possibly involving custom functions or parametric plotting to accurately represent the described geometries.
